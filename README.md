## Owner goals 
The  main purpose of creating this website was to get my project done and present my learning outcomes from JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
## User goals

# How the game works
Rock Paper Scissors is a game that has stood the test of time and continues to bring joy and excitement to people of all ages. The concept is simple, yet the strategic possibilities make it a fascinating and engaging game.

# The three choices
The game revolves around three basic choices: rock, paper, and scissors. Each choice represents a different object or gesture:

Rock: It's a solid choice that can crush scissors.
Paper: It can cover rock and render it useless.
Scissors: They can cut through paper, making it ineffective.

# Rules of engagement
The rules of Rock Paper Scissors are straightforward:

Rock beats scissors: The mighty rock can break the scissors, earning victory.
Scissors beat paper: The sharp blades of the scissors can cut through the paper, claiming the win.
Paper beats rock: Paper can wrap around the rock, rendering it powerless.

# The psychology of play 
While Rock Paper Scissors may seem like a game of chance, there is an element of psychology that can come into play. Observing your opponent's patterns, anticipating their moves, and strategically adjusting your choices can give you an edge.

# Issues found during the development
Some issues with js code , first not linking then not performing as expected ,what

i thought may have been a logical error  in my  function  turned out to be an error
 
in the naming of the elements and placement of the id's. i founf this issues using
  
chrome developer tools as well,as going online with tutor support, also when 

deploying to git hub pages i found that my file paths where incorrect so i had to 

remedy that.
